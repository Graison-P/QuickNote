# consoleSummary
An AI-Powered Windows cmdlet that makes summaries of webpages without a website
# Usage
Using consoleSummary is simple, use the command ```cs```. To use in one-shot mode, append a url as an argument. Not appending a url will put you in interactive mode.
# Why is CS not open-source?
CS isn't open-source as the AI service uses (HuggingFace) removes your API key if it is found online. Making this project open-source would cause my API key to be terminated, and this program would become useless.
